# Adversarial Feature Maps Super Resolution
This repository is the Implementation of our paper: <br>
Imanuel, I. and Lee, S. (2022), Super-resolution with adversarial loss on the feature maps of the generated high-resolution image. Electron. Lett., 58: 47-49. https://doi.org/10.1049/ell2.12360

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing are taken from this repository. <br>
Training Dataset:
1. Locate inside the "Dataset" folder from the referenced repository
2. Extract the files
3. After you extract the files, you can find High Resolution data is inside "HIGH" folder, and Low Resolution data is inside "LOW" folder
4. You can modify the dataset directory to your needs in this code inside "dataset/data_train.py".

Testing dataset is inside "testset" which you can download from the referenced repository. You can modify the dataset directory to your needs in this code inside "dataset/data_test.py".

# Results
The results provided in this repository are from the model trained for 5 epochs. To achieve results like in the paper, train the model for 100 epochs. After training for 100 epochs, the result should be similar to the ones in the paper:

# Running
To train the model using VGG16 pretrained network:
```python train_vgg.py --gpu your_gpu_number``` <br><br>
To train the model using ResNet18 pretrained network:
```python train_resnet.py --gpu your_gpu_number``` <br><br>
To test the model on the low-resolution widerface dataset:
```python test.py``` <br>
The file will be saved inside the "test_res" folder <br><br>
To evaluate the model using the FID metric, run the following command: <br>
```python evaluation/fid_score.py ./Dataset_bulat/HIGH/SRtrainset_2/ ./test_res/```

abstract = {Abstract Recent studies on image super-resolution make use of Generative Adversarial Networks to generate the high-resolution image counterpart of the low-resolution input. However, while being able to generate sharp high-resolution images, Generative Adversarial Networks based super-resolution methods often fail to produce good results when tested on images having different degradation as the low-resolution images used in the training. Some recent works have tried to mitigate this failure by introducing a degradation network that can replicate the noise of real-world low-resolution images. However, even these methods can produce poor results if a real-world test image differs much from the real-world images in the training data set. This paper proposes the use of adversarial losses on the feature maps extracted by a pre-trained network with the generated high-resolution image as input. This is in contrast to all other Generative Adversarial Networks-based super-resolution methods that directly apply the adversarial loss to the generated high-resolution image. The rationale behind this idea is illustrated, and experimental results confirm that high-resolution images generated by the proposed method achieve better results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations than methods that directly apply adversarial losses to generated high-resolutionÂ images.},
