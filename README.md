abstract = {Abstract Recent studies on image super-resolution make use of Generative Adversarial Networks to generate the high-resolution image counterpart of the low-resolution input. However, while being able to generate sharp high-resolution images, Generative Adversarial Networks based super-resolution methods often fail to produce good results when tested on images having different degradation as the low-resolution images used in the training. Some recent works have tried to mitigate this failure by introducing a degradation network that can replicate the noise of real-world low-resolution images. However, even these methods can produce poor results if a real-world test image differs much from the real-world images in the training data set. This paper proposes the use of adversarial losses on the feature maps extracted by a pre-trained network with the generated high-resolution image as input. This is in contrast to all other Generative Adversarial Networks-based super-resolution methods that directly apply the adversarial loss to the generated high-resolution image. The rationale behind this idea is illustrated, and experimental results confirm that high-resolution images generated by the proposed method achieve better results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations than methods that directly apply adversarial losses to generated high-resolutionÂ images.},
